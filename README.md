# Pytorch Code Examples
These code examples are short (less than 300 lines of code), focused demonstrations of vertical deep learning workflows.  All of these examples are written as Jupyter notebooks and can be run in one click in Google Colab, a hosted notebook environment that requires no setup and runs in the cloud. Google Colab includes GPU and TPU runtimes.
